# Deployment-Deep-Learning-Model
Waste segregation is a critical step in waste management, and its effective implementation can reduce the risk of environmental problems. In this project, we propose a website that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify waste into six categories (cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash) based on images. The dataset contains various images of possible wastes categorized into major groups, which were used to train the model. We developed an algorithm for image processing and classification using CNN and evaluated its performance on real-world images.
